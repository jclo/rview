# Introduction

**RView** is a companion View library for building web applications. On the opposite of React, VueJS and Angular, View focuses on the viewing operations only. Besides, **RView** has a very fast learning curve as it doesn't introduce any new directives, pseudo-code, build, etc.

Thus, **RView** is only intended to create web components, insert them into the DOM and update them.

`RView` allows you to create and modify an HTML template. When you apply a change to your template, `RView` checks the differences between your template and its counterpart in the DOM. It updates only the elements that have been modified.
